# Trovit!

I implemented two solutions to solve the problem submitted:  
* The first one is done with a technological stack I am proficient with : Amazon Web Services, SQL and Python. It is the most performant solution and the one that gives the best result. This is the serious solution and the one I would use if I had to put the project in production tomorrow.  

* For the second one I used Apache Spark and Scala which I am not so comfortable with as I don't work with these tools on a daily basis and have never used them on a professional context. I rather did it as an opportunity to practice, learn and have a bit of fun along the way :)
